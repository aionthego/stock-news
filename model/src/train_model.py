                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's a thinking process to arrive at the desired JSON output:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request asks to process a JSON file (`stock_news.json`) containing news articles categorized by stock ticker (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NFLX, NVDA, INTC, IBM). For *each* article, the goal is to extract specific information: the title, the link, the ticker, and a concise, factual summary of the *main topic* of the article, focusing on the company associated with the ticker. The summary should be 1-2 sentences and avoid speculation or opinions.

2.  **Input Data Structure:** The input is a JSON object where keys are stock tickers (e.g., \"AAPL\"). The value for each key is a list of JSON objects, each representing a news article. Each article object has keys: \"title\", \"link\", \"ticker\", and \"full_text\".

3.  **Output Data Structure:** The desired output is a JSON object with the *same structure* as the input: a dictionary where keys are tickers, and values are lists of article objects. However, the article objects in the output should have \"title\", \"link\", \"ticker\", and a new key \"summary\" containing the generated summary, replacing the \"full_text\".

4.  **Core Task: Summarization:** The most crucial part is generating the summary for each article's `full_text`. The summary needs to be:
    *   **Concise:** 1-2 sentences.
    *   **Factual:** Based *only* on the provided text.
    *   **Relevant:** Focused on the *main topic* concerning the specific company (identified by the `ticker`).
    *   **Neutral:** Avoid opinions, speculation, or forward-looking statements *unless* they are directly reported as facts within the article (e.g., \"The company *announced* plans to...\").

5.  **Processing Strategy:**
    *   Iterate through each ticker in the input JSON (`stock_news.json`).
    *   For each ticker, iterate through the list of articles associated with it.
    *   For each article:
        *   Read the `title`, `link`, `ticker`, and `full_text`.
        *   Analyze the `full_text` to identify the central theme related to the `ticker` company.
        *   Consider the `title` as a strong hint for the main topic.
        *   Draft a 1-2 sentence summary focusing on the identified main topic and the specific company.
        *   Refine the summary to ensure it's factual, concise, and neutral.
        *   Create a new article object containing `title`, `link`, `ticker`, and the generated `summary`.
    *   Collect the processed article objects into a list for the current ticker.
    *   Store this list in the output JSON object under the corresponding ticker key.
    *   After processing all tickers and articles, format the final result as a JSON string.

6.  **Detailed Summarization - Example Walkthrough (AAPL Article 1):**
    *   **Ticker:** AAPL
    *   **Title:** \"Apple Inc. (AAPL) Teases New Product Launch with AI and In-House Modem\"
    *   **Full Text:** (Scan the text) Mentions AI stocks, Chinese stocks/DeepSeek issues (distractions from AAPL's core news), hedge funds (meta-commentary), then focuses on Apple. Key points about Apple: Bloomberg report on Feb 19 product launch, Tim Cook's tweet (\"newest member of the family\"), potential end of home button, inclusion of Apple Intelligence, A18 chip, and in-house cellular modem.
    *   **Identify Main Topic (re: AAPL):** Apple is teasing a new product launch expected on Feb 19, potentially featuring AI (Apple Intelligence), the A18 chip, and an in-house modem, possibly marking the end of the home button.
    *   **Draft Summary:** Apple is teasing a new product launch for Feb 19, described by CEO Tim Cook as the \"newest member of the family.\" Reports suggest it may include Apple Intelligence, the A18 chip, an in-house modem, and potentially remove the home button.
    *   **Refine:** Looks good. Factual, concise (2 sentences), relevant to AAPL, neutral.

7.  **Detailed Summarization - Example Walkthrough (AAPL Article 3):**
    *   **Ticker:** AAPL
    *   **Title:** \"Apple Supplier Foxconn's Efforts To Make iPhones In India Thwarted By Tech And Talent Exports: Report\"
    *   **Full Text:** Focuses on Foxconn (Apple supplier) facing difficulties expanding iPhone production in India due to China restricting technology and talent exports. Mentions Foxconn's earnings and China's broader strategy.
    *   **Identify Main Topic (re: AAPL):** Apple supplier Foxconn is reportedly facing challenges expanding iPhone manufacturing in India because China is restricting the export of necessary technology and engineering talent.
    *   **Draft Summary:** Apple supplier Foxconn is reportedly encountering obstacles in expanding its iPhone production operations in India. These difficulties stem from China tightening restrictions on the export of technology and engineering talent needed for manufacturing.
    *   **Refine:** Good. Factual, concise (2 sentences), relevant to AAPL (via its supplier), neutral.

8.  **Detailed Summarization - Example Walkthrough (MSFT Article 1):**
    *   **Ticker:** MSFT
    *   **Title:** \"Microsoft-Backed OpenAI Introduces SWE-Lancer Benchmark\"
    *   **Full Text:** Mostly paywalled, but the visible part clearly states: \"Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI on Tuesday introduced SWE-Lancer, a benchmark of more than 1,400 free...\"
    *   **Identify Main Topic (re: MSFT):** Microsoft-backed OpenAI introduced a new benchmark called SWE-Lancer.
    *   **Draft Summary:** Microsoft-backed OpenAI introduced SWE-Lancer, a new benchmark comprising over 1,400 software engineering tasks.
    *   **Refine:** Concise, factual, relevant. Good. *Self-correction: Initially might just say \"introduced SWE-Lancer benchmark\", but adding the detail about software engineering tasks from the visible text makes it slightly more informative.*

9.  **Detailed Summarization - Example Walkthrough (INTC Article 1):**
    *   **Ticker:** INTC
    *   **Title:** \"Intel (INTC) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\"
    *   **Full Text:** Mentions stock jump after WSJ report about talks with Broadcom and TSMC to sell assets. Broadcom interested in product business, TSMC in factories. Notes potential value unlock.
    *   **Identify Main Topic (re: INTC):** Intel's stock rose following a report that it is in talks with Broadcom and TSMC about potentially selling parts of its business, with Broadcom eyeing the product division and TSMC the manufacturing facilities.
    *   **Draft Summary:** Intel's stock price increased following a Wall Street Journal report indicating the company is in preliminary talks with Broadcom and TSMC about potential deals. The report suggests Broadcom is interested in Intel's product business, while TSMC is exploring acquiring control of some manufacturing facilities.
    *   **Refine:** Factual, concise, relevant, neutral. Good.

10. **Apply Systematically:** Repeat the summarization process for *every* article under *every* ticker, adhering strictly to the requirements (concise, factual, relevant to the ticker, neutral). Pay attention to paywalled articles â€“ summarize only based on the visible text (title and snippet). Handle articles that mention the target company only tangentially (like the Buffett/OXY article under AAPL) by focusing *only* on the part relevant to the target ticker, or stating that the article primarily discusses another topic but mentions the target company in a specific context (e.g., Buffett selling AAPL).

11. **Assemble Final JSON:** Construct the final JSON object using the processed data, ensuring the structure matches the requirement (dictionary of tickers, each mapping to a list of article objects with `title`, `link`, `ticker`, `summary`).

12. **Final Review:** Read through the generated summaries to double-check for conciseness, factual accuracy based *only* on the source text, relevance to the ticker, and neutrality. Ensure no opinions or external knowledge crept in. Check the overall JSON structure."""),

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a high-level summary of the provided news articles, which are already individually summarized and grouped by ticker.

2.  **Identify Key Themes/Patterns Across Tickers:**
    *   **AI Dominance:** AI is a recurring theme across almost all companies (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, INTC, IBM). This includes new product launches (AAPL), AI capabilities driving business (MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, IBM), AI partnerships (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, IBM), and AI hardware/software development (NVDA, INTC, MSFT, AMZN).
    *   **Market Performance & Analyst Commentary:** Many articles discuss stock performance, analyst ratings, price target adjustments, and earnings reports/previews (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, INTC, NFLX, IBM).
    *   **Strategic Moves & Partnerships:** Companies are making strategic moves like partnerships (AAPL with Alibaba/Baidu, MSFT/OpenAI, AMZN/MSK, NFLX/Apple TV, IBM/Penn State), acquisitions/divestitures (INTC potential breakup, NVDA stake changes), and new product/service launches (AAPL iPhone SE, MSFT/OpenAI benchmark, AMZN Inspire shutdown, NFLX live sports).
    *   **Competitive Landscape:** The articles highlight competition, especially in AI (NVDA vs. rivals, INTC vs. AMD/TSMC), streaming (NFLX vs. others), and cloud (MSFT Azure, AMZN AWS).
    *   **Regulatory/Political Environment:** Some articles touch on government actions, DEI policies, and trade issues affecting companies (AAPL Foxconn/China, AMZN boycott, INTC CHIPS Act, Trump's FCPA order).
    *   **Specific Company News:**
        *   **AAPL:** New product tease (AI, modem), iPhone SE launch, Foxconn India challenges, China AI partnerships.
        *   **MSFT:** OpenAI developments (benchmark, board), strong cloud/AI performance, legacy tech AI resurgence.
        *   **AMZN:** Inspire shutdown, AWS AI in healthcare, potential retail boycott.
        *   **NFLX:** Strong subscriber growth, live sports expansion, Apple TV app integration, high profitability.
        *   **NVDA:** Strong AI chip demand, earnings anticipation, stake changes in Arm/WeRide, analyst views on Blackwell transition.
        *   **INTC:** Potential breakup/asset sales to Broadcom/TSMC, stock surge on rumors, turnaround challenges.
        *   **IBM:** AI business growth (Watsonx), partnerships (Penn State), legacy tech AI resurgence.

3.  **Structure the Summary:** A good structure would be:
    *   Overall market sentiment/major trends.
    *   Ticker-by-ticker highlights, focusing on the most significant news for each.
    *   Concluding thought if applicable.

4.  **Draft the Summary - Iteration 1 (Mental or rough notes):**
    *   Market: AI is huge. Tech stocks moving. Some Magnificent Seven less magnificent, others (legacy) rising.
    *   AAPL: New AI product, iPhone SE, China AI.
    *   MSFT: OpenAI stuff, cloud AI strong.
    *   AMZN: Shutting down Inspire, AWS AI in health.
    *   NFLX: Subs up, live sports, Apple TV.
    *   NVDA: Earnings soon, AI chip king, some stake changes.
    *   INTC: Big news about possible breakup, stock up.
    *   IBM: AI doing well, partnerships.

5.  **Refine and Elaborate - Iteration 2 (Adding detail and flow):**

    \"The news covers a lot of ground, with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence across major tech players.
    Apple (AAPL) is teasing a new AI-integrated product with an in-house modem, likely an iPhone SE update, and is expanding AI efforts in China through partnerships.
    Microsoft (MSFT) continues to feature prominently with its OpenAI collaboration, including new benchmarks and discussions on OpenAI's governance, while its cloud and AI businesses drive strong performance.
    Amazon (AMZN) is making strategic shifts, shutting down its Inspire shopping feed but expanding AWS's AI footprint in healthcare.
    Netflix (NFLX) reported strong subscriber growth, is pushing further into live sports, and appears to be finally integrating with Apple's TV app.
    NVIDIA (NVDA) remains central to the AI narrative, with high anticipation for its upcoming earnings, discussions around its chip transitions (Hopper to Blackwell), and recent changes in its investment portfolio, including a reduced stake in Arm.
    Intel (INTC) saw significant stock movement on reports of potential deals with Broadcom and TSMC that could lead to a breakup of the company, as it navigates turnaround challenges.
    IBM is also highlighted for its AI business growth, particularly with Watsonx, and new partnerships like the one with Penn State for an AI student assistant.
    Broader themes include ongoing analyst commentary on stock valuations and price targets, the competitive AI landscape, and the impact of geopolitical and regulatory factors on tech operations.\"

6.  **Final Polish - Iteration 3 (Conciseness, clarity, stronger verbs, better transitions):** This leads to the example summary provided previously. I'd look for opportunities to combine related points, use more active voice, and ensure the summary flows logically from one company to the next while also capturing overarching themes. For instance, instead of just saying \"AI is huge,\" I'd weave it into the specific company actions. I'd also try to group similar types of news (e.g., product launches, strategic partnerships, financial performance) if it makes sense across multiple companies.

This iterative process, moving from broad understanding to specific details and then back to a refined overview, helps create a comprehensive yet digestible summary."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, here's a high-level summary of the key news items from the provided `stock_news.json` data:

*   **Netflix (NFLX)** reported strong subscriber growth, exceeding expectations, and is making a bigger push into live sports content. There are also reports that Netflix will finally support integration with Apple's TV app. Analysts are generally positive, citing advertising revenue potential and international growth.
*   **NVIDIA (NVDA)** remains a central figure in the AI boom, with high anticipation for its upcoming earnings (Feb 26). Analysts are watching its transition to new chip architectures (like Blackwell) and the impact of China trade restrictions. Nvidia also made changes to its investment portfolio, notably reducing its stake in Arm Holdings while taking new stakes in companies like WeRide.
*   **Intel (INTC)** experienced a significant stock surge following reports that rivals Broadcom and TSMC are exploring potential deals that could lead to a breakup of the company. This comes as Intel continues its challenging turnaround efforts in chip manufacturing and design.
*   **IBM** is also seeing positive momentum from its AI business, particularly with its Watsonx platform, and is forming new partnerships, such as with Penn State University to develop an AI-powered student assistant.

**Broader Trends:**

*   **Analyst Activity:** Numerous articles detail analyst upgrades, downgrades, and price target adjustments for these tech giants, reflecting active re-evaluation of their prospects.
*   **Strategic Partnerships & M&A:** Companies are actively forming partnerships (especially in AI) and exploring M&A or divestitures to strengthen their positions.
*   **Market Sentiment:** There's discussion about market bullishness (low cash levels for fund managers) but also concerns about Big Tech valuations and potential market shifts.
*   **Regulatory & Geopolitical Factors:** Issues like US-China trade tensions, DEI policies, and government regulations (e.g., FCPA, CHIPS Act) continue to influence company operations and strategies."""),

                types.Part.from_text(text="""Here's a thinking process that leads to the comprehensive answer about integrating the JSON data:

1.  **Understand the Core Request:** The user wants to know *how* to use the provided JSON data (news summaries) with *their* application. This is a broad question, so the answer needs to cover various aspects and potential use cases.

2.  **Identify Key Characteristics of the Data:**
    *   **Structure:** It's JSON, organized by stock ticker, then an array of news items. Each item has `title`, `link`, `ticker`, and `summary`.
    *   **Content:** News summaries related to specific companies.
    *   **Potential Value:** Provides timely, concise information about publicly traded companies.

3.  **Brainstorm Potential Application Types:** What kind of applications would benefit from this data?
    *   Financial dashboards/portfolios
    *   News aggregators
    *   Investment research tools
    *   Trading bots (with caution)
    *   Alerting systems
    *   Content generation (e.g., market reports)
    *   Sentiment analysis tools

4.  **Outline the Integration Steps (General Workflow):** Regardless of the specific application, some steps will be common.
    *   Data Acquisition (How does the app get the JSON?)
    *   Data Parsing (How does the app understand the JSON?)
    *   Data Storage (Optional, but likely for many apps)
    *   Data Processing/Analysis (What does the app *do* with the data?)
    *   Data Presentation/Usage (How is the data shown or used?)

5.  **Flesh out each step with details and considerations:**

    *   **Data Acquisition:**
        *   **Static File:** If `stock_news.json` is a one-off, how to load it? (File I/O)
        *   **Dynamic Source (API):** More realistic for real-world apps. Mention HTTP requests, authentication, rate limiting.
        *   **Frequency:** How often to update?

    *   **Data Parsing:**
        *   Standard JSON libraries in various languages (Python's `json`, JavaScript's `JSON.parse`).
        *   Data validation (is the structure as expected?).

    *   **Data Storage (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   Why store it? (History, performance, offline access).
        *   Database options: Relational (SQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Elasticsearch).
        *   Schema design considerations (how to structure tables/collections).

    *   **Data Processing & Analysis (The \"Meat\" of the Application):** This is where the application's unique logic comes in.
        *   **Filtering:** By ticker, keywords in summary/title.
        *   **Searching:** Full-text search.
        *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Using NLP libraries.
        *   **Trend Detection:** (More advanced) Identifying recurring themes.
        *   **Alerting:** Based on keywords, sentiment shifts, specific tickers.
        *   **Aggregation:** Counting news items per ticker, etc.

    *   **Data Presentation & Usage:**
        *   **UI Display:** Lists, cards, dashboards.
        *   **Notifications:** Push, email, SMS.
        *   **API Output:** If the app itself is an API.
        *   **Reports:** Generating summaries.

6.  **Provide Concrete Examples (Code Snippets):** Abstract advice is good, but code makes it real. Python is a good general-purpose choice.
    *   Loading and parsing a local file.
    *   Fetching from a hypothetical API.
    *   Basic filtering.

7.  **Consider Different Application Scenarios (Use Cases):** Elaborate on the brainstormed application types.
    *   **Personal Portfolio Tracker:** Show news relevant to user's holdings.
    *   **News Aggregator/Alert System:** Filter by keywords, send alerts.
    *   **Investment Research Tool:** Sentiment analysis, historical news.
    *   **Automated Trading (High-Level Caution):** Mention complexity and risks.

8.  **Add Important Considerations/Best Practices:**
    *   **Error Handling:** What if the JSON is malformed or the API is down?
    *   **Scalability:** How will it perform with more data/users?
    *   **Security:** If fetching from an API, API keys. If storing data, database security.
    *   **Data Freshness:** How to ensure data is up-to-date.
    *   **Rate Limiting/API Etiquette:** If using external APIs.
    *   **User Experience (UX):** How to present the information effectively.

9.  **Structure the Answer Logically:**
    *   Start with a general overview.
    *   Break down into steps.
    *   Provide examples.
    *   Discuss use cases.
    *   List important considerations.
    *   Conclude with a call to action (ask for more details about *their* app).

10. **Refine and Review:**
    *   Clarity and conciseness.
    *   Correctness of technical details.
    *   Completeness â€“ did I miss anything obvious?
    *   Is it easy to understand for someone who might not be an expert?
    *   Emphasize that the \"best\" way depends on *their specific application*.

**(Self-correction during the process):**
*   Initially, I might have just jumped to code. But then I'd realize the user needs the \"why\" and \"what\" before the \"how.\"
*   I might forget to mention error handling or scalability, then add them in as crucial real-world aspects.
*   I should explicitly state that the `stock_news.json` is likely a *sample* and real applications would need a dynamic data source.
*   Ensure to highlight that the \"summary\" field is already provided, which is a great starting point for many applications, but further processing (like sentiment) can add more value."""),
                types.Part.from_text(text="""Okay, let's break down how you can use this JSON data model with your application. The best approach depends heavily on what your application is designed to do.

Here's a general guide, followed by specific examples for different types of applications:

**I. General Steps for Integration:**

1.  **Data Acquisition/Ingestion:**
    *   **Static File (like the one provided):** If this `stock_news.json` is a one-time data dump or updated infrequently, your application will need to read this file from its local storage or a designated location.
    *   **Dynamic Source (API):** In a real-world scenario, this data would likely come from an API. Your application would make HTTP requests (e.g., GET requests) to an endpoint that returns this JSON. You'd need to handle authentication, rate limits, etc.
    *   **Database:** The data might be pre-processed and stored in a database, and your application would query this database.

2.  **Parsing the JSON:**
    *   Once you have the JSON string (either from a file or an API response), you'll need to parse it into a native data structure in your programming language.
        *   **Python:** `import json; data = json.loads(json_string)` or `with open('stock_news.json', 'r') as f: data = json.load(f)`
        *   **JavaScript (Node.js/Browser):** `const data = JSON.parse(jsonString);` or if fetching: `const response = await fetch(url); const data = await response.json();`
        *   **Java:** Using libraries like Jackson or Gson.
        *   **C#:** Using `System.Text.Json` or Newtonsoft.Json.

3.  **Data Storage (Optional but often recommended):**
    *   For performance, historical analysis, or offline access, you might want to store this data in a database.
    *   **Relational (SQL):** You could have tables for `Stocks` (ticker, company_name) and `NewsArticles` (article_id, stock_ticker, title, link, summary, timestamp).
    *   **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch):** A document-based store like MongoDB could store each news item as a document. Elasticsearch would be excellent for searching the summaries and titles.

4.  **Processing and Logic:**
    *   This is where your application's core functionality comes in. What do you want to *do* with the news?
    *   Filter by ticker.
    *   Search by keywords in `title` or `summary`.
    *   Analyze sentiment of the `summary`.
    *   Track news frequency for specific stocks.

5.  **Presentation/Output:**
    *   Display the news in a user interface (web page, mobile app).
    *   Send alerts (email, push notifications) based on certain criteria.
    *   Feed into an algorithmic trading model (with extreme caution and robust testing).
    *   Generate reports.

**II. Example Application Scenarios & How to Use the Model:**

**Scenario 1: A Stock Portfolio Tracker with News Feed**

*   **Goal:** Show users news relevant to the stocks they own.
*   **How to use the model:**
    1.  User adds \"AAPL\" and \"MSFT\" to their portfolio.
    2.  Your application fetches/loads the JSON.
    3.  It iterates through the top-level keys (tickers: \"AAPL\", \"MSFT\", etc.).
    4.  If a key matches a stock in the user's portfolio (e.g., \"AAPL\"), retrieve the array of news items for that ticker.
    5.  Display the `title`, `summary`, and `link` for each relevant news item in a feed, perhaps sorted by a timestamp (if available, otherwise by order in the array).

    ```python
    # Python Example
    import json

    # Assuming stock_news.json is loaded into 'all_news_data'
    # with open('stock_news.json', 'r') as f:
    #     all_news_data = json.load(f)

    user_portfolio = [\"AAPL\", \"MSFT\"]
    relevant_news = []

    for ticker in user_portfolio:
        if ticker in all_news_data:
            for news_item in all_news_data[ticker]:
                relevant_news.append({
                    \"ticker\": news_item[\"ticker\"],
                    \"title\": news_item[\"title\"],
                    \"summary\": news_item[\"summary\"],
                    \"link\": news_item[\"link\"]
                })

    # Now 'relevant_news' can be displayed to the user
    for item in relevant_news:
        print(f\"[{item['ticker']}] {item['title']}: {item['summary'][:100]}... ({item['link']})\")
    ```

**Scenario 2: A News Alert System**

*   **Goal:** Notify users if news contains specific keywords (e.g., \"AI\", \"partnership\", \"earnings beat\") for stocks they follow.
*   **How to use the model:**
    1.  User subscribes to alerts for \"NVDA\" with keywords \"AI\" or \"Blackwell\".
    2.  When new data arrives (e.g., from an API, or a file update is detected):
        *   Parse the JSON.
        *   Iterate through news items for \"NVDA\".
        *   For each item, check if `summary` or `title` contains \"AI\" or \"Blackwell\" (case-insensitive).
        *   If a match is found, send a notification to the user with the `title` and `link`.

**Scenario 3: An Investment Research Tool**

*   **Goal:** Allow users to search news, analyze sentiment, and see historical news trends.
*   **How to use the model:**
    1.  **Storage:** Store all news items in a database (e.g., Elasticsearch for search, or a SQL DB with full-text search capabilities). Add a `received_timestamp` field.
    2.  **Search:** User enters \"Intel breakup\". Your application queries the database for news items where `summary` or `title` contains these terms.
    3.  **Sentiment Analysis:** For each `summary`, use an NLP library (e.g., NLTK, spaCy in Python, or a cloud AI service) to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Store this sentiment score. Users can then filter news by sentiment.
    4.  **Historical Trends:** Users can view all news for \"AAPL\" from the last week/month, or see how many positive/negative news items appeared for \"TSLA\" over time.

**Scenario 4: Content Aggregation for a Financial Blog/Website**

*   **Goal:** Automatically pull and display recent news summaries for various tech stocks.
*   **How to use the model:**
    1.  Periodically fetch/load the JSON.
    2.  Iterate through all tickers and their news items.
    3.  For each item, create a small news blurb on your website: `<h3>{news_item['title']} ({news_item['ticker']})</h3> <p>{news_item['summary']}</p> <a href='{news_item['link']}'>Read more</a>`.
    4.  You might want to implement a system to avoid displaying duplicate news if you're fetching frequently.

**Scenario 5: Feeding Data to a Machine Learning Model**

*   **Goal:** Use news summaries to predict stock price movements or volatility (highly advanced and speculative).
*   **How to use the model:**
    1.  **Feature Engineering:**
        *   Extract sentiment scores from `summary`.
        *   Use TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) on the `summary` and `title`.
        *   Count occurrences of specific financial keywords.
        *   Combine with other data (price, volume).
    2.  **Model Training:** Train a model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to correlate these news features with subsequent market behavior.
    3.  **Prediction:** When new news arrives, process it and feed it to the trained model.
    *   **Important Caveat:** This is extremely complex, and news sentiment alone is rarely a reliable predictor of short-term price movements.

**Key Considerations for Your Application:**

*   **Data Freshness:** How up-to-date does the news need to be? This will dictate how often you fetch/refresh the data.
*   **Scalability:** If you expect many users or a large volume of news, consider efficient data storage and querying (databases, indexing).
*   **Error Handling:** What if the JSON is malformed? What if an API call fails?
*   **User Interface (UI):** How will you present this information in a clear and useful way?
*   **Specific Needs:** Do you need to track when you last saw a particular news item to avoid duplicates? Do you need to categorize news beyond just the ticker?
