# stock-news

This project trains a stock news model daily on text data using Vertex AI and BERT.

Future plans include extending training to audio and video news data.

This project supports a daily stock news feed in the following formats:

- Text (JSON)
- Audio (WAV)
- Video (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV)

Stock news analysis goes beyond just natural language processing (NLP); sentiment analysis is a crucial component.

Here's why sentiment analysis is so important in this context:

    
    Market impact: The sentiment expressed in news articles can significantly influence stock prices. Positive news often leads to an increase in stock value, while negative news can cause it to decrease.
    
    Investment decisions: Investors and traders use sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment and make informed investment decisions.
    
    Risk assessment: Sentiment analysis can help identify potential risks associated with a particular stock or market sector.
    
    Algorithmic trading: Many algorithmic trading strategies incorporate sentiment analysis to automate trading decisions based on real-time news sentiment.


By combining NLP techniques (to understand the content of the news) with sentiment analysis (to determine the emotional tone and opinion expressed), stock news models can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the news' potential impact on the market.

This is why models like BERT are often used in conjunction with sentiment analysis techniques in stock news analysis projects. BERT can help extract relevant information and context from the text, which can then be used to perform sentiment analysis and predict market movements.
